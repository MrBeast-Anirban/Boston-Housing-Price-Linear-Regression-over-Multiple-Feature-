# Boston-Housing-Price-Linear-Regression-over-Multiple-Feature-
We are using Boston Housing Dataset which is the most famous Dataset by scikit learn. Here we will be predicting the price of house based on the multiple features of House such as Color, Area, Bedrooms, Floors etc. The main goal will be to create a linear regression model that can predict prices of house if a new feature set of houses is given with more accuracy based on the model sketched using our available feature set and there corresponding labels. I had used vectorization to make our code least expensive based on execution time and it turned out taking less than 0.5 seconds.
